## Welcome to Saturated Fats and Cardiovascular Disease

This is a project to explore data wrangling, unification of data sets, the use of OpenRefine, and data visualization.

### Resources

The graph is made using [Plotly.Js](https://plot.ly/), a declarative charting library built on top of d3.js and stack.gl.

## How this graph was made:

1 Collect data from open sources: 
*  World Health Organization: [Mortality and cholesterol ](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A859?lang=en)
* Oxford University: Department of Public Health. [European cardiovascular disease statistics](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiLx-mwjJHTAhXpxVQKHRNODgAQFggmMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhf.org.uk%2F-%2Fmedia%2Ffiles%2Fresearch%2Fheart-statistics%2Fhs2008ec_european_cardiovascular_disease_statistics_2008.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFk5R9fDrsKuUV-sXQeb-f4qocB4A&sig2=imynDDrk7603HmyEb2w7MA&bvm=bv.152174688,d.eWE) (This is the PDF download link)

2 Clean and unify data sets using [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/). 

3 Structure the data.

4 Experiment with different visualization options.

5 Choose the graph that best explains the data. In this case a scatter plot.
